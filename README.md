Generated Sketches after 79500 training iterations

The training set consists of 1001 unique grayscale images of pencil sketches of birds, horses, butterflies, disney characters, male and female faces, flowers, hearts, hands, still life, and other miscellanious objects. The image data was also flipped to produce a total of 2002 pencil sketches.
